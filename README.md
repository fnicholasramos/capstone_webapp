# Capstone Web Application

This project is a web application developed as part of our capstone project for school academic requirement. The application serves as a data management system for patient information, aiming to provide a more efficient and systematic process for encoding patient records. By providing a structured, user-friendly platform, the application aims to enhance data handling processes.

This project is created and will be part of [Ospital ng Maynila](https://www.facebook.com/ommcofficial/), who will serve as our client and primary source of information that will guide us in gathering the essential knowledge and requirements needed for effective and secure data management.
